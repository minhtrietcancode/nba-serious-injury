# üèÄ NBA Serious Injury Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes serious injuries among NBA players, focusing on key factors that may influence injury risk and impact on player performance. The analysis uses a dataset of player statistics and injury records, with visualizations and insights provided in a Jupyter notebook.

## Project Structure
- `analysis.ipynb`: Main notebook containing the data analysis, visualizations, and insights.
- `dataset_and_description/PlayerStats.csv`: Dataset with NBA player statistics and injury information.
- `dataset_and_description/dataset-description.md`: Description of the dataset and its features.

## Key Features Analyzed
- Player demographics (age, height, weight)
- Injury type and history
- Season and career stage
- Change in performance after injury
- Average minutes played
- BMI (Body Mass Index)

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.
3. Run the cells to reproduce the analysis and visualizations.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib

Install dependencies with:
```bash
pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib
```

## Insights
- Players with higher average minutes and BMI around 24 are more likely to suffer serious injuries.
- ACL and Achilles injuries have the most significant negative impact on player careers.
- Injury risk varies by age, height, weight, and previous injury history.
